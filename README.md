# Game of Life (GoL)
Python implementation of John Conway's Game of Life (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

After specifying grid size 'N' and total number of generations 'T' each generation is saved as a 
.png file to current directory. Frequency of saved generations can be edited by adjusting the 'write_frequency' variable 
on line 53 of GoL.py. A user can demo the code within the supplied Jupyter Notebook and create an animated .gif of all
generations stitched together. 

Example animated .gif output with N=250 and T=250:
